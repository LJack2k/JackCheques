#
#   This file has been inspired by the guys at DiscordSRV. They make a very awesome
#   Discord plugin for Spigot that I recommend to everybody. Since I'm a beginner
#   coder I learned a lot from their code. Copied a lot of the structure of DiscordSRV
#   because it is so damm good.
#
#   You should totaly check them out at https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/
#   or their github https://github.com/Scarsz/DiscordSRV
